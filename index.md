## About This Book

**Minds and Machines: A First Look at AI** is designed as the definitive companion for the CAI 1001C Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. This textbook provides a balanced blend of theory and practice, ensuring students not only understand the concepts behind AI but can build, evaluate, and think critically about intelligent systems.

:::{grid-item-card} 🎯 Design Philosophy
:class-card: sd-border-primary

Every chapter follows a consistent **50/50 structure**: the first half covers theory and lecture content with clear explanations and real-world examples, while the second half provides hands-on guided labs, activities, exercises, and discussion questions. **Learn by doing — not just by reading.**
:::

:::{grid-item-card} 🛠️ Platform Integration
:class-card: sd-border-primary

All hands-on activities are built around three core platforms: **Google Gemini** for AI interaction and prompt engineering, **Google AI Studio** for model exploration and experimentation, and **Google Colab** for Python-based development and projects. **Kaggle** is used throughout for real-world datasets.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} 📋 Competency Aligned
:class-card: sd-border-primary

Every chapter, section, and activity is mapped to the official **CAI 1001C course competencies** (see Appendix G), ensuring complete coverage of all seven competency areas and their sub-objectives.
